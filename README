mergy - a svn cherry-pick-assisant 

Idea:
The inspiration came from John Resig's pulley (http://ejohn.org/blog/pulley/)

mergy can assist in feature-branch driven development. 
If you're pushing all, ticket-related or not, commits to a single branch, where
you're picking specific revision of important changes or finished tickets to merge
them into your stable trunk - mergy can do a lot of repeating tasks for you:

- create diff before merge, for quick review without additional tools like reviewboard
- selecting un-merged revision from branches
- filtering important and ticket-related revision
- auto-commit to trunk
- auto-update remote servers
- execute pre- and post-merge actions (e.g. phpunit)

Usage:
mergy.sh [--remote=[repository|branch]]     // remote repository, might be only a branch-name
         [--rev=revision[,revision]]        // revisions to merge (might have been merged before)
         [--force=keyword[,keyword]]        // keywords to force merge of this revisons, if unmerged
         [--ticket=ticket-id[,ticket-id]]   // find all revisions of a ticket
         [--config=mergy.json]              // use this config-file
         [--path=[PATH_TO_WC]]              // use this working copy (instead of .)
         [--continue]                       // continue skips the pre-merge-actions (e.g. after conflict)
         [--reintegrate]                    // reintegrate a whole branch - without specific revisions
         [--list]                           // list unmerged revisions from repository
         [--diff]                           // create a diff, based on the revisions to merge
         [--all]                            // use all unmerged revisions
         [--diff-all]                       // equals --diff --all
         [--verbose]                        // verbose
